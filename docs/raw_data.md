# Raw Data
## MSAs
The raw MSAs for ProteinNet12 are available for download upon request. The data is large, approximately 4TB in size, and requires a Globus client for downloading. Please [email us](mailto:alquraishi@hms.harvard.edu) to request access.

Once we are able to provide broad access we will post a public Globus endpoint for all ProteinNets.

## Sequence databases
If you wish to generate new MSAs using the same sequence databases used to construct ProteinNet, you may download the sequence databases in FASTA format using the links below. Note that the databases range in size from ~700MB (ProteinNet7) to ~44GB (ProteinNet12).
